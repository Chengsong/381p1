Model 2 is a variation of the original model with a new notion of "roles" introduced. There exists 3 lanes on the map, \{safe, mid, off\}, and at least one hero should be assigned to each lane to have any realistic chance of winning. Over the course of evolution of the game and its playerbase, people have began to realize that certain heroes perform significantly better at one specific lane, and started categorizing each hero by the lane it shines at. People also noticed that some formation performs better than others, specifically "2/1/2" and "3/1/1" are acknowledge as the best formations currently. Therefore, this model adds further constraints to original model by restricting the team formatations and which leans each heroes can play effectively.

The LP was modeled the following way:
Let binary variables $x_{ij}$ represent the $i$th hero playing at $j$th lane, and $w_{ij}$ be the general win rate of $i$th hero playing at $j$th lane.
The objective then is to maximize the function $\sum_{i, j} w_{ij}x_{ij}$ which represents the average win rate if we divide by a constant number (5). This value is 0 if the hero is not meant to play at this lane.
Constraints -
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sum_{i, j} x_{ij} = 5$ [exactly 5 heroes must be picked]
\item $\sum_{j} x_{ij} \leq 1$, for all $i$ [each hero can take at most 1 lane]
\item $\sum_{i} x_{ij} = 1$, for $j = 0$ [mid lane must only have 1 hero]
\item $1 \leq \sum_{i} x_{ij} \leq 2$, for $j = 1$ [off lane lane must have 1 or 2 heroes]
\item $2 \leq \sum_{i} x_{ij} \leq 3$, for $j = 2$ [safe lane lane must have 2 or 3 heroes]
\end{enumerate}

The code to generate this LP model as input to lp\_solve was fairly straightforward, because we already have the data about the win rate of each hero at each lane, and it is set to 0 as default if the hero is not played in a lane. The input data files are "Middle_pickrate_winrate.csv", "Off_pickrate_winrate.csv", and "Safe_pickrate_winrate.csv", where the first column represents the presence of the hero at the lane and the second column represents the win rate (presence was never actually used). Each constraint was generated by iterating through $i = 0$ to 114 (115 heroes), and $j = 0$ to 2 (3 lanes), inclusive.

The solution of this model with average win rate of 0.57178:
Hero: Abaddon, Lane: off
Hero: Necrophos, Lane: off
Hero: Omniknight, Lane: safe
Hero: Spectre, Lane: safe
Hero: Visage, Lane: mid

We can approximately verify the solution by picking 1000 random choices of 5 heroes that confirms to the role constraint, and confirm that our solution indeed has the highest win rate. See figure <x>. <insert appropriate figure number in x for verification.png> The figure shows that our opt solution, designated as a red line, has significantly higher win rate than the other random teams, which verifies its legitimacy.

This is a realistic solution based on empirical experience. <Dino plz elaborate here>

The binding constraints were the heroes that got chosen, of course, and the formation constraints. The optimal formation discovered by the LP solver is $2/1/2$ which makes the upper bound of off line and lower bound of safe line binding. This result is actually very interesting because the dominant strategy for pro games currently is the 1/3/1 formation. This can possibly be explained by the fact that the data used in this calculation is gathered from all levels of play, from lowest ranks to pro players, so $2/1/2$ might be more viable in the lower rankings.

This solution is vastly different from the result of model 1. <Dino plz elaborate here regarding to the roles of each hero>
